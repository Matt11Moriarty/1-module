# Module 1: Refactor code for Horiseon SEO

## Description

This repository contains starter code from an existing website for an SEO agency.
I have refactored the code, making it more readable and adding comments to improve readability.

- This was done so that any one who would like to view this site and it's code can more easily understand how it is formatted with HTML and CSS.
- Previously, the code was in a confusing state and was fairly unreadable. 
- In refactoring this code, I learned a lot about reading and using CSS. I am now much more confident in understanding how to set up styling and present it in a readable way.
